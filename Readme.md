### Title 
Learning Transferable Time-Series Models From Natural Language Supervision

### Abstract
This thesis researches relationship between cryptocurrency time series data and Twitterâ€™s tweets about them. By converting time series into images, the original CLIP model is trained to understand new relationships. Then a modified CLIP model is proposed that accepts time series directly without the need for any conversion.
